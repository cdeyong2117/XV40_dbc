# XV40_dbc
Creating a standalone .dbc file for the XV40 Camry platform.

This repository is a WIP for a .dbc file for signals found in Toyota XV40 platform vehicles.
These are found experimentally by analysing recorded frames from the vehicle and validated as well as possible on a test-bench.

All of my testing/RE work is done using the ESP32 CANdue, and Collin Kidder's SavvyCAN. I make no promises that this is complete or 100% accurate, use at your own risk.
